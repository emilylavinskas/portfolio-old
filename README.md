I am a graphic designer with a passion for editorial design, web design and photography.

In 2005, I developed an interest in what went into designing websites and magazines. My family always encouraged me to become a graphic designer. It wasn't until 2011 that I realized that they were right. In 2013, I decided to pursue graphic design after high school, and it has been a passion of mine ever since.
